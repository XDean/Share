- Named your branch as bitbucket convention
  - feature/issue-1-what-feature

  - hotfix/issue-3-what-fix
- Add ticket number before every commit
  - `git commit -m 'issue-4 do something'`


# Tips

- Keep your branch up-to-date
- Use `-p` when do `fetch` or `pull` to prune useless remote branches
